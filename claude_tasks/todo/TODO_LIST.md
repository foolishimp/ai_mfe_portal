## Instructions

### Adding Todos
- Use the `/todo` slash command: `/todo "implement new feature"`
- Items are added with timestamp for quick capture
- Convert important items to formal tasks in active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md

### Managing Todos
- ✅ **Completed**: Mark with checkmark and move to finished tasks if significant
- ❌ **Cancelled**: Remove or mark as cancelled if no longer needed
- ➡️ **Promoted**: Move to active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md as formal tasks

### Todo vs Task Difference
- **Todos**: Quick capture, informal, immediate thoughts
- **Tasks**: Formal, estimated time, acceptance criteria, TDD process

### Cleanup Process
- Review todos regularly (daily/weekly)
- Promote important items to formal tasks
- Remove completed or outdated items
- Keep this list focused and actionable

*Todo items are meant for quick capture. For formal development work, create proper tasks in active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md following the TDD methodology.*
