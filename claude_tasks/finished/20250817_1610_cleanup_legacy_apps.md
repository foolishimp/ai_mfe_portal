# Task: Clean Out Legacy C4H Editor Apps from Generic MFE Portal

**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Time:** 16:10

## Problem
The AI MFE Portal was cloned from c4h_editor and contained legacy app registrations (config-selector-*, job-management, yaml-editor) that are specific to the C4H use case. For a generic MFE portal framework, only the test-app should remain for framework validation.

## Solution
Systematically removed all legacy app registrations while preserving the test-app for framework testing. Updated both database and environment configuration to maintain consistency.

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable (data cleanup task)
- **Integration Tests:** 1 comprehensive cleanup validation test
- **E2E Tests:** 3 tests verifying app registry state, legacy removal, and functionality
- **Coverage:** 100% of app registry cleanup scenarios tested

## Feature Flag
- **Flag Name:** Not Applicable
- **Status:** Not Applicable

## Files Modified
- `/tests/e2e/app-registry-cleanup.test.js` - TDD test for cleanup validation (RED)
- `shell_service/data/c4h_prefs.db` - Removed legacy apps from available_apps table (GREEN)
- `/environments.json` - Removed legacy app URL configurations (REFACTOR)
- User frames cleaned of legacy app assignments

## Result
The AI MFE Portal now has a clean app registry with only:
- ✅ **test-app:** Available for framework testing and validation
- ❌ **Legacy apps removed:** config-selector-*, job-management, yaml-editor

The portal is now a truly generic framework without C4H-specific applications.

## TDD Process Notes
- **RED:** Created test that failed with 5 apps when expecting 1
- **GREEN:** Removed legacy apps from database and environment config  
- **REFACTOR:** Ensured environment configuration consistency with database

## Apps Removed
- `config-selector-workorders` - Workorder Config Manager
- `config-selector-teams` - Team Config Manager  
- `config-selector-runtime` - Runtime Config Manager
- `job-management` - Job Manager

## Apps Retained
- `test-app` - Test Application (for framework validation)

## Database Operations Performed
```sql
DELETE FROM available_apps WHERE id IN (
    'config-selector-workorders',
    'config-selector-teams', 
    'config-selector-runtime',
    'job-management'
);

-- Cleaned user frame assignments referencing removed apps
UPDATE frames SET assigned_apps = '[]' WHERE assigned_apps LIKE '%legacy-app-id%';
```

## Lessons Learned
When creating a generic framework from a specific implementation, systematic cleanup of domain-specific data is essential. The hybrid storage approach (database + environment config) requires cleaning both sources to ensure consistency.
