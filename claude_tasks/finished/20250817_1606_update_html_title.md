**Status:** Completed
**Date:** 2025-08-17
**Time:** 16:06

## Problem
The AI MFE Portal was cloned from the legacy c4h_editor project and still contained references to "C4H Editor" in the HTML title and UI components, causing confusion about which application was actually running.

## Solution
Updated all legacy references to "C4H Editor" throughout the codebase to properly reflect "AI MFE Portal" branding.

## Test Coverage
- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable (UI text changes)
- **Integration Tests:** Manual verification of title display
- **E2E Tests:** Verified portal loads with correct title
- **Coverage:** 100% of identified legacy references updated

## Feature Flag
- **Flag Name:** Not Applicable
- **Status:** Not Applicable

## Files Modified
- `/packages/shell/index.html` - Updated HTML title tag
- `/packages/shell/src/components/common/Navigation.tsx` - Updated UI header text
- `/packages/shell/src/components/layout/MainLayout.tsx` - Updated main layout titles
- `/startup.sh` - Updated script description
- `/global.d.ts` - Updated TypeScript global type declarations comment

## Result
The AI MFE Portal now displays correct branding in:
- Browser tab title: "AI MFE Portal"
- Main header: "AI MFE Portal"
- Subtitle: "Microfrontend Framework"
- All legacy "C4H Editor" references removed

## TDD Process Notes
- **RED:** Not applicable (text update task)
- **GREEN:** Direct text replacement to fix branding
- **REFACTOR:** Ensured consistent branding across all UI components

## Lessons Learned
When cloning projects, systematic search and replace of legacy branding is essential to avoid confusion. Using grep to find all instances of legacy text ensures comprehensive cleanup.
