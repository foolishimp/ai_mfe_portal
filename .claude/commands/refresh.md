# Refresh Development Context

Please perform the following tasks in order:

1. **Reread Core Documentation:**
   - Read CLAUDE.md to understand project context and development methodology
   - Read claude_tasks/QUICK_REFERENCE.md for TDD workflow
   - Read claude_tasks/PRINCIPLES_QUICK_CARD.md for the 7 core principles
   - Read claude_tasks/DEVELOPMENT_PROCESS.md for complete methodology

2. **Review Active Tasks:**
   - Read claude_tasks/active/ACTIVE_TASKS.md
   - Analyze current task statuses and priorities
   - Identify any tasks marked as "completed" or "done"

3. **Clean Up Completed Tasks:**
   - For any completed tasks found in ACTIVE_TASKS.md:
     - Create properly formatted files in claude_tasks/finished/ using format YYYYMMDD_HHMM_task_name.md
     - Use the task template format from QUICK_REFERENCE.md
     - Include test coverage, TDD process notes, and results
     - Remove the completed tasks from ACTIVE_TASKS.md
   - Update the "Last Updated" timestamp in ACTIVE_TASKS.md

4. **Provide Summary:**
   - Summarize current project state
   - List remaining active tasks with priorities
   - Note any blockers or issues found
   - Suggest next steps based on current task queue

This command ensures I have full context of the project's development methodology and current state before proceeding with any work.
